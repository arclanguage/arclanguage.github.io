Arc provides support for hash tables.  An entry in the table is
accessed by treating the table as a function on the key.  For example, to look
up <code>key</code> in table <code>tab</code>: <code>(tab key)</code>.  If the key is not present,
<code>nil</code> is returned.
The <code>=</code> operator can be used to assign values to a table:
<code>(= (tab key) 'value)</code>.

See also <a href="template.html">template operations</a>, which provide a more complex abstraction on top of tables.
