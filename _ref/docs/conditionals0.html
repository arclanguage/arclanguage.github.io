The fundamental conditional operator in Arc is <code>if</code>.  It is similar to the Lisp <code>if</code>, except it eliminates the parentheses around the clauses.  For a simple conditional with multiple body statements, <code>when</code> or its opposite <code>unless</code> can be used.
<p>
Arc provides several conditionals that assign the test expression to a variable, similar to <code>let</code>.  The <code>iflet</code>, <code>caselet</code>, and <code>whenlet</code> macros are useful if the test expression is used inside the body.
