Arc provides several operations for error handling and non-linear control flow.
Since Arc's control flow mechanisms are built on top of MzScheme, see the MzScheme manual on <a href='http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-6.html#node_chap_6'>exceptions and control flow</a> for details.
<p>
Arc's simplest mechanism for non-linear control flow is <code>catch</code> and <code>throw</code>.  This allows execution to jump back to the <code>catch</code> expression, for example to exit a loop early.
<pre class="repl">
arc> (catch (each x '(2 4 6 9 10 12) (prn "Examining " x) (if (odd x) (throw x))))

<p>
Arc also provides access to MzScheme's exception mechanism, which provides a way to trap errors or raise error.

The <code>ccc</code> function is equivalent to Scheme's <code>call-with-current-continuation</code> (often abbreviated as <code>call/cc</code>).  Continuations are extremely powerful; for details

In MzScheme, continuations are relatively expensive if the call stack is deep since capturing a continuation copies the stack.
