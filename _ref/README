To generate the documentation after making changes to the .tem
template files, run:

$ ./generate.sh

The resulting output will appear in the output/ directory.  You can
open the output/index.html file directly in your web browser; you
don't need to be running a web server.

When you're happy with your changes, push to github to update
http://arclanguage.github.io.

This Arc documentation was originally written by Ken Shirriff
<kens@arcfn.com>, and is now community-supported.
