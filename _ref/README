This directory generates the Arc documentation published at
http://arcdoc.eval.to/

To generate the documentation after making changes to the .tem
template files, run:

$ ./generate.sh

The resulting output will appear in the output/ directory.  You can
open the output/index.html file directly in your web browser; you
don't need to be running a web server.

When you're happy with your changes commit them to Anarki.  We'll put
together some system to automatically publish commits to Anarki to
arcdoc.eval.to; in the meantime, ping <andrew.wilcox@gmail.com> to
push the button.

NOTE: I (Andrew) couldn't figure out how to run Anarki from the
arcfn-docs directory, so I used the hackinator instead.  *You don't
have to do this*.  Just fix generate.sh to use Anarki instead if you
want.

How the automatic process will work:  It will
 - pull the latest code from Anarki
 - run generate.sh
 - copy the contents of output/ to arcdoc.eval.to

This Arc documentation was originally written by Ken Shirriff
<kens@arcfn.com>, and is now community supported in Anarki.
