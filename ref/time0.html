Arc provides several functions to determine the current time, measure time intervals, and measure the execution time of expressions.  Many of the 
functions use a system-dependent time base, which is typically the number of seconds since January 1, 1970; see the MzScheme <a href="http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-15.html">time documentation</a> for details.

One rather complex procedure is <code>cache</code>, which creates a procedure that generates and caches a value.  <code>cache</code> takes a function to generate the cache lifetime, as well as a function to generate the value to cache. 
The value function is executed the first time the created procedure is called, and will be executed again only if the created procedure is called when the cache lifetime has expired.  Otherwise, the cached value is returned.  Typically a cache is used when the value function is something expensive to evaluate.
The motivation behind dynamically computing the cache lifetime is that the lifetime can be modified for an existing cache, for instance through a global variable. 
<pre class="repl">
