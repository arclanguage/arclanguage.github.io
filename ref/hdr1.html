The Arc language is implemented by a "foundation" of functionality
implemented in Scheme in 
<code>ac.scm</code>.  On top of this the <a
href="http://paulgraham.com/core.html">core</a> of the language is implemented
in the Arc language itself in <code>arc.arc</code>.  Finally, various libraries
are implemented on top of the core.  This page provides some documentation
of the functionality in the foundation.
<p>
In one sense, the foundation can be considered the "<a
href="http://paulgraham.com/arcchallenge.html">axioms</a>", and the full language is
created out of these axioms.  However, in my view, the current foundation
both contains too much and too little to be considered an axiomatic base.
For example, it contains enough networking functionality to implement a
web server, but not enough to fetch a web page.  The math functions include
square root and exponentiation, but not trigonometry.  Nonetheless, the
foundation provides the basis for a very interesting language.
For more information on how the foundation is implemented, see my article
<a href="http://arcfn.com/2008/02/arc-internals-part-1.html">Arc Internals</a>.
<p>
This reference was created using Arc. An Arc data structure contains the
functions, descriptions and test examples, and an Arc program processes this
data structure to generate html. The examples on the right, for the most part,
show actual output from running the embedded code while generating the page.
(A few commands, such as quit and the socket operations, are not suitable for
execution in this way and their output was "faked".)

you find anything unclear or anomalous.
