The Arc language is implemented by a "foundation" of functionality
implemented in Scheme in 
<code>ac.scm</code>.  On top of this the <a
href="http://paulgraham.com/core.html">core</a> of the language is implemented
in the Arc language itself in <code>arc.arc</code>.  Finally, various libraries
are implemented on top of the core.  This page provides some documentation
of the functionality in the foundation.
<p>
In one sense, the foundation can be considered the "<a
href="http://paulgraham.com/arcchallenge.html">axioms</a>", and the full language is
created out of these axioms.  However, in my view, the current foundation
both contains too much and too little to be considered an axiomatic base.
For example, it contains enough networking functionality to implement a
web server, but not enough to fetch a web page.  The math functions include
square root and exponentiation, but not trigonometry.  Nonetheless, the
foundation provides the basis for a very interesting language.
For more information on how the foundation is implemented, see my article
<a href="http://arcfn.com/2008/02/arc-internals-part-1.html">Arc Internals</a>.

Arc was used to generate this document.  I created a large Arc data structure
holding the functions, arguments, description, headings, and test examples.
I wrote a program in Arc that processes this data structure to generate the
HTML file for this page.
The functions are linked to the <a
href="http://practical-scheme.net/wiliki/arcxref">Arc Cross Reference</a>
website. 
The examples on the right, for the most part, show actual output from running
the embedded code while generating the page.  This ensures that the examples
show actual behavior of the arc2 release.
(A few commands, such as
quit and the socket operations, are not suitable for execution in this
way and their output was "faked".) 
<p>
The documentation below is based on my exploration of the language.
Undoubtedly this document contains many errors.  In addition, the language is undergoing
active modification.  This documentation is based on the "arc3" release.
