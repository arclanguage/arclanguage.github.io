The Arc language is implemented by a "foundation" of functionality
implemented in Scheme in <code>ac.scm</code>. On top of this the <a
href="http://paulgraham.com/core.html">core</a> of the language is implemented
in the Arc language itself in <code>arc.arc</code>. Finally, various libraries
are implemented on top of the core. This page provides some documentation
of the functionality in the foundation. For more information on how the
foundation is implemented, see the article
<a href="http://arcfn.com/2008/02/arc-internals-part-1.html">Arc Internals</a>.

This reference was created using
<a href='https://github.com/arclanguage/arclanguage.github.io/blob/master/_ref/generate.sh'>an Arc program</a>
The examples on the right, for
the most part, show actual output from running the embedded code while
generating the page. (A few commands, such as quit and the socket operations,
are not suitable for execution in this way and their output was "faked".)
Please inform <a href='http://arclanguage.org/forum'>the forum</a> if you find
anything unclear or anomalous.
