Arc has a large variety of I/O operations that support file, string, and network I/O.  Because Arc's I/O system is based on MzScheme, the <a href="http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-11.html">MzScheme I/O documentation</a> provides useful background.
<p>
Arc's I/O system is built in layers.  The <a href="/foundation-doc.html">foundation</a> provides basic operations.  On top of this, more functional operations are constructed.  The <code>w/</code> (with/) series of operations are generally the most convenient.
<p>
One main I/O abstraction in Arc is the port: an input port produces bytes and an output port consumes bytes.  A port may be created by opening a file or socket.  In addition, Arc supports string I/O, where a string can provide data as an input port, or can receive data as an output port.
<p>
For input, Arc provides support to read a byte, character, line, or Scheme S-expression.  (Because Arc inherit's MzScheme's Unicode support, one Unicode character may involve more than one byte.)
Some of Arc's input operations indicate end-of-file through a user-specified eof value.  This can be a symbol such as <code>'eof</code> or <code>nil</code>.
<p>
Arc's read methods take a variety of arguments: some require a port, some default to <code>stdin</code>, and some allow a string as input.  Some take an arbitrary number of body statements, while some take a "thunk", a function to evaluate.  
<p>
Arc provides multiple operations for output.  The <code>prn</code> procedure is useful for general-purpose printing, as well as for debugging.  By wrapping it with <code>w/stdout</code>, the output can be directed to a file or string.
<p>
Arc supports formatted output, with very limited control over formatting.  The <code>prf</code> operation uses a format string, which can contain two types of formatting directives.  A "#" followed by a form causes the form to be evaluated.  A "~" followed by an ignored character causes the directive to be replaced by the next argument.  For example:
<pre class="repl">
arc> (let x 42 (prf "#(+ 1 1) ~x #x\n" 111))
2 111 42
""
</pre>
<p>
One convenient pattern in Arc is to read and write S-expressions to avoid encoding and parsing data.  Multiple operations support reading S-expressions, either individually or an entire set at once, from multiple sources.  If the syntactic correctness of the input is uncertain, <code>saferead</code> can be used.
<p>
Arc also includes multiple string I/O operations that allow a string to be used for input or output.  The simplest operations are <code>fromstring</code> and <code>tostring</code>, for input or output respectively. See <a href='http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/372/html/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-11.html#node_sec_11.1.5'>MzScheme String Ports</a> for background on String Port I/O.
